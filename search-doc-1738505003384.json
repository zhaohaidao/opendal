We're writing this blog post to announce that the Apache OpenDAL™ Project will be participating in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024. If you're not eligible or interested in participating in GSoC, then most of this post likely isn't relevant to you; if you are, this should contain some useful information and links. Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual global program organized by Google that aims to bring new contributors to the world of open-source. The program pairs organizations (such as the OpenDAL Project) with contributors (usually students), with the goal of helping the participants make meaningful open-source contributions under the guidance of experienced mentors. Google is sponsoring the 2024 Summer of Code and The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) registered as a mentoring organization. The GSoC applicants now have several weeks to send project proposals to organizations that appeal to them. If their project proposal is accepted, they will embark on a 12-week journey during which they will try to complete their proposed project under the guidance of an assigned mentor. We have prepared a list of project ideas that can serve as inspiration for potential GSoC contributors that would like to send a project proposal to the OpenDAL project. However, applicants can also come up with their own project ideas. You can discuss project ideas or try to find mentors on the maillist or Discord. We have also prepared a proposal guide that should help you with preparing your project proposals. You can start discussing the project ideas with OpenDAL Project maintainers immediately. The project proposal application period starts on March 18, 2024, and ends on April 2, 2024 at 18:00 UTC. Take note of that deadline, as there will be no extensions! If you are interested in contributing to the OpenDAL Project, we encourage you to check out our project idea list and send us a GSoC project proposal! Of course, you are also free to discuss these projects and/or try to move them forward even if you do not intend to (or cannot) participate in GSoC. We welcome all contributors to OpenDAL, as there is always enough work to do. We are excited about this event. Hoping you all feel the same way!

For example, for S3, OpenDAL manually constructs HTTP requests and parses HTTP responses to ensure that all behaviors comply with API specifications and are fully under the control of OpenDAL. Due to OpenDAL's native takeover of the data access process, we can easily implement unified retry and logging mechanisms for various storage backends and ensure behavioral consistency.  For compatible services with S3, due to the limitations of native storage services and differences in API implementation, compatibility and behavioral details may differ from S3. For example, OSS needs to set an independent header to ensure consistent behavior for Range.

OpenDAL is an Apache Incubator project aimed at helping users access data from various storage services in a unified, convenient, and efficient way. Its project vision is &quot;free access to data&quot;:  Free from services: Any service can be accessed freely through native interfacesFree from implementations: No matter how the underlying implementation is, it can be called in a unified wayFree to integrate: Able to freely integrate with various services and languagesFree to zero cost: Users don't have to pay for features they don't use  On this philosophical foundation, OpenDAL Rust Core can be mainly divided into the following components:  Operator: The outer interface exposed to usersLayers: Specific implementation of different middlewareServices: Specific implementation of different services  From a macroscopic perspective, OpenDAL's data reading call stack would look like this:    All Layers and Services have implemented a unified Accessor interface, erasing all type information when building the Operator. For the Operator, regardless of what services are used or how many middleware are added, all call logic is consistent. This design splits OpenDAL's API into Public API and Raw API, where the Public API is directly exposed to users, providing convenient top-level interfaces, and Raw API is provided to OpenDAL internal developers, maintaining a unified internal interface and providing some convenient implementation.

For example, OpenDAL offers the following APIs for read:  op.read(path): Reads the entire content of the specified fileop.reader(path): Creates a Reader for streaming readingop.read_with(path).range(1..1024): Reads file content using specified parameters, such as rangeop.reader_with(path).range(1..1024): Creates a Reader for streaming reading with specified parameters  It's not hard to see that read is more like syntactic sugar, allowing users to quickly read files without considering various traits like AsyncRead. The reader provides more flexibility, implementing widely-used community traits like AsyncSeek, AsyncRead, allowing more flexible data reading. read_with and reader_with assist users in specifying various parameters in a more natural way through Future Builder functions.  The internal logic of the Operator would look like this:    Its main job is to encapsulate the interface for the user:  Completing the construction of OpRead: the args for read operation.Calling the read function provided by AccessorWrapping the returned value as Reader and implementing interfaces like AsyncSeek, AsyncRead, etc., based on Reader  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Layers​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Apache OpenDAL™ Internal: Data Reading","url":"/blog/how-opendal-read-data#layers","content":" A little secret here is that OpenDAL will automatically apply some Layers to the Service to implement some internal logic. As of the completion of this article, OpenDAL's automatically added Layers include:  ErrorContextLayer: Injects context information, such as scheme, path, etc., into all returned errors of OperationCompleteLayer: Adds necessary capabilities to services, such as adding seek support to s3TypeEraseLayer: Implements type erasure, uniformly erasing associated types in Accessor, so users don't need to carry generic parameters when using it  Here, ErrorContextLayer and TypeEraseLayer are relatively simple and won't be elaborated on. The focus is on CompleteLayer, aimed at adding seek or next support to OpenDAL's returned Reader in a zero-cost way, so users don't have to re-implement it. OpenDAL initially returned Reader and SeekableReader through different function calls in early versions, but the actual user feedback was not very good; almost all users were using SeekableReader. Therefore, OpenDAL subsequently added seek support as the first priority to the internal Read trait during the refactor:  pub trait Read: Unpin + Send + Sync { /// Read bytes asynchronously. fn poll_read(&amp;mut self, cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;, buf: &amp;mut [u8]) -&gt; Poll&lt;Result&lt;usize&gt;&gt;; /// Seek asynchronously. /// /// Returns `Unsupported` error if underlying reader doesn't support seek. fn poll_seek(&amp;mut self, cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;, pos: io::SeekFrom) -&gt; Poll&lt;Result&lt;u64&gt;&gt;; /// Stream [`Bytes`] from underlying reader. /// /// Returns `Unsupported` error if underlying reader doesn't support stream. /// /// This API exists for avoiding bytes copying inside async runtime. /// Users can poll bytes from underlying reader and decide when to /// read/consume them. fn poll_next(&amp;mut self, cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Poll&lt;Option&lt;Result&lt;Bytes&gt;&gt;&gt;; }   To implement a service's reading capability in OpenDAL, one needs to implement this trait, which is an internal interface and will not be directly exposed to users. Among them:  poll_read is the most basic requirement; all services must implement this interface.When the service natively supports seek, poll_seek can be implemented, and OpenDAL will correctly dispatch, such as local fs;When the service natively supports next, meaning it returns streaming Bytes, poll_next can be implemented, like HTTP-based services, where the underlying layer is a TCP Stream, and hyper will encapsulate it as a bytes stream.  Through the Read trait, OpenDAL ensures that all services can expose their native support capabilities as much as possible, thereby achieving efficient reading for different services.  Based on this trait, OpenDAL will complete according to the capabilities supported by each service:  Both seek/next are supported: Direct returnNo support for next: Encapsulate using StreamableReader to simulate next supportNo support for seek: Encapsulate using ByRangeSeekableReader to simulate seek supportNeither seek/next supported: Encapsulate using both methods  ByRangeSeekableReader mainly utilizes the service's ability to support range read, dropping the current reader when the user seeks and initiating a new request at the specified location.  OpenDAL exposes a unified Reader implementation through CompleteLayer, so users don't have to worry about whether the underlying service supports seek; OpenDAL will always choose the optimal way to initiate the request.

Using async_compat::Compat, we have transformed it into futures::AsyncRead and futures::AsyncSeek. Based on this, we provide a built-in function oio::into_read_from_file to transform it into a type that implements oio::Read.  There's nothing particularly complex in the implementation of oio::into_read_from_file; read and seek are mostly calling the functions provided by the incoming File type. The tricky part is about the correct handling of seek and range: seeking to the right side of the range is allowed, and this will not cause an error, and reading will only return empty, but seeking to the left side of the range is illegal, and the Reader must return InvalidInput for proper upper-level handling.

Here's an extra note about a small pitfall with reqwest/hyper: reqwest and hyper do not check the returned content length, so an illegal server may return a data volume that does not match the expected content length instead of an error, leading to unexpected data behavior. OpenDAL specifically added checks here, returning ContentIncomplete when data is insufficient and ContentTruncated when data exceeds expectations, avoiding users receiving illegal data.

We've found, however, that this led to significant duplication between append and write. As a result, we've streamlined the two functionalities into a single write function. Our users can now:  let mut w = op.writer_with(&quot;test.txt&quot;).append(true).await?; w.write(content_a).await?; w.write(content_b).await?; w.close().await?;   This way, users can reuse the Writer in their own logic without handling append separately.  New Lister API​  To improve API consistency, we've made some adjustments to our listing functions. We've added list and list_with methods that perform single operations and renamed the original list to lister and lister_with.  // Old API let lister: Lister = op.list(&quot;dir&quot;).await?; // New API let entries: Vec&lt;Entry&gt; = op.list(&quot;dir&quot;).await?; let lister: Lister = op.lister(&quot;dir&quot;).await?;   This brings uniformity to our API offerings.  List With Metakey​  To speed up list operations, OpenDAL can now fetch and store metadata during the listing process. This eliminates the need for separate metadata calls:  let entries: Vec&lt;Entry&gt; = op .list_with(&quot;dir/&quot;) .metakey(Metakey::ContentLength | Metakey::ContentType).await?; // Use the metadata directly! let meta: &amp;Metadata = entries[0].metadata();   This makes metadata retrieval more intuitive.

You should include an abstract that explains your project in one or two paragraphs, and then a very detailed description that explains what exactly do you want to achieve in the proposed project. The proposal should also clearly state the designated mentor(s) for your project (you should get in touch with them before submitting the proposal).  In addition to describing what do you intend to work on in the project, you should also specify the size of the project, according to the GSoC documentation:  Small: ~90 hoursMedium: ~175 hoursLarge: ~350 hours  You should also create an approximate weekly plan of work and a list of deliverables. Recall that the default project duration is 12 weeks, but it can be extended (for medium and large projects) by up to 22 weeks.  Describe a brief outline of the work that you plan to do, and try to estimate how will the work be split in the individual weeks of the project.Define milestones that you intend to achieve in specific weeks (e.g. finish X in week 4, deliver Y in the middle of the project, have a final version prepared one week before the end of the project, etc.). You should focus specifically on the midterm point (week 6), because your mentor(s) will evaluate your progress at this time. You should be slightly more than half done at this moment, and have something reasonable to show.In week 11 (one week before the end of the project), you should consider doing a &quot;code freeze&quot;, and spend the last week to polish tests and documentation.  Of course, it is quite difficult to predict this timeline exactly in advance, and it is not a problem to modify it while the project runs, but try to guesstimate it to the best of your ability.  Furthermore, let us know what is your intended time commitment for working on the project. How many hours per day can you work on it? Are there specific days of the week when you can work on it? Is there some period of time from May to August where you know in advance that you won't be able to work on it? Please include this information in the proposal.  There is a Community bonding period before the contributors start working on their projects. It is designed to help you learn about the community that you're going to contribute to, and to start familiarizing yourself with the code and/or technology of your project.
